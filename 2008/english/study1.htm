<p>　　The newly completed Condensed Matter Science and Physics Building is a 14 
floor building with an approximate total area of 26,000 m2. The Department of 
Physics is conveniently located next to the newly constructed National Taiwan 
University Sports Center, at the corner of Shin-Hai and Hsin-Sheng South Roads. 
In addition to dedicated research laboratories and facilities, there is a 206 
seat international conference hall spanning the second and third floor of the 
building.<br>
　　In addition, there is a lecture hall with 143 seats located on the first 
floor. The Department of Physics also allocated an area of 840 m2 to the 
library. The reading room and book stack occupy 180 m2 and 660 m2, respectively. 
More than 20,000 books, in excess of 40,000 bound periodicals, and 105 current 
journals form a complete collection of literature in the library.<br>
　　The Physics Department also allocated substantial resources to teaching 
excellence. In all, there are 4 stepped classrooms, 1 dedicated computer room, 8 
discussion rooms, and 3 undergraduate teaching laboratories. Furthermore, the 
students can engage in academic exercises in conveniently located study and 
discussion rooms within the department. Excellent infrastructure is provided by 
the Physics Department to promote research and teaching.<br>
<br>
Computing Facilities<br>
　　In addition to the PC and workstations operated and by the individual 
researchers and laboratories, there are 40 personal computer in Room 305, 
another 5 in Room 301 and 3 Terminals in Room 302. To optimize computing usage 
and facilitate information flow, all computers in the Department are connected 
by ethernet, and connected to the NTU Computing Center by optical fibers. The 
university network is then connected to the Ministry of Education and the 
education network (TANET).<br>
　　Through the internet, departmental offices and research laboratories can 
connect to the national and international databases and computing facilities. 
All students also have access to personal computers and the internet.<br>
<br>
Library<br>
　　The department library moved to Room 310 of Condensed Matter Sciences and New 
Physics Building in February 2001. The library occupies two floors with a total 
space around 700 square meters. The first floor consists of the Library Office, 
the Reading Room with current journals and the regular periodical room. The 
second floor houses general books and rare journals. The library collection 
includes approximately 60,000 volumes of books, and more than 400 kinds of 
journals.<br>
　　There are more than 140 professional journals in the Reading Room and three 
internet-ready computers are available to search for the information on books 
and periodicals. There is also one television and a video player for viewing the 
audio-visual materials. Four photocopiers are provided for the readers?copying 
needs. By housing a solid collection of science books and professional journals, 
The library provides a book and periodical service to researchers in Northern 
Taiwan (Taipei) area. This initiative is partially funded by National Science 
Council under the project of Taipei Area Physics Books Service.<br>
