　　The newly completed Condensed Matter Science and Physics Building is a 14 floor building with an approximate total area of 26,000 m2. The Department of Physics is conveniently located next to the newly constructed National Taiwan University Sports Center, at the corner of Shin-Hai and Hsin-Sheng South Roads. In addition to dedicated research laboratories and facilities, there is a 206 seat international conference hall spanning the second and third floor of the building.<br>　　In addition, there is a lecture hall with 143 seats located on the first floor. The Department of Physics also allocated an area of 840 m2 to the library. The reading room and book stack occupy 180 m2 and 660 m2, respectively. More than 20,000 books, in excess of 40,000 bound periodicals, and 105 current journals form a complete collection of literature in the library.<br>　　The Physics Department also allocated substantial resources to teaching excellence. In all, there are 4 stepped classrooms, 1 dedicated computer room, 8 discussion rooms, and 3 undergraduate teaching laboratories. Furthermore, the students can engage in academic exercises in conveniently located study and discussion rooms within the department. Excellent infrastructure is provided by the Physics Department to promote research and teaching.<br><br>Computing Facilities<br>　　In addition to the PC and workstations operated and by the individual researchers and laboratories, there are 40 personal computer in Room 305, another 5 in Room 301 and 3 Terminals in Room 302. To optimize computing usage and facilitate information flow, all computers in the Department are connected by ethernet, and connected to the NTU Computing Center by optical fibers. The university network is then connected to the Ministry of Education and the education network (TANET).<br>　　Through the internet, departmental offices and research laboratories can connect to the national and international databases and computing facilities. All students also have access to personal computers and the internet.<br><br>Library<br>　　The department library moved to Room 310 of Condensed Matter Sciences and New Physics Building in February 2001. The library occupies two floors with a total space around 700 square meters. The first floor consists of the Library Office, the Reading Room with current journals and the regular periodical room. The second floor houses general books and rare journals.
