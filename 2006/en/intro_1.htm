　　The undergraduate program physics was established at National Taiwan University in 1946. The master program was established twenty four years later in 1960 and and the Ph.D. programs set up nine years later 1969. As the oldest leading institution in Taiwan which conducts physics teaching and research, the Physics Department played a key role in the development and growth of the physics community in Taiwan. Under the academic tradition of National Taiwan University, the Department has its own unique character,and consistenly rank on the top in the physical sciences category of the nation-wide College Entrance Examination. Since its foundation, the Department has produced numerous outstanding alumni who have made significant contributions both within Taiwan and at the international level.<br>　　They excelled in both academia and industry. Building on a solid background, the Department strives to further the advancement of physics education in Taiwan. We hope to be able to provide the optimal environment in which future generations of physics students can continue to study and conduct research.<br>　　In order to enhance the diversity and depth of our research program, the Physics Department actively recruit faculty members. In addition, the department also interacts extensively with the NTU Center for Condensed Matter Sciences and numerous institutes within Academia Sinica including the Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, the Institute of Physics, and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences.Faculty members of the department also participate in the Ministry of Education's Program for Promotion of Academic Excellence of Universities and other National Projects.<br>　　In addition, faculty members also actively participate in international academic activities. The Department strives to build a top notch program both in the Taiwanese and the international physics community.<br>　　As the foundation of natural sciences, physics is a broad field aiming to study the laws of nature governing the motion and properties of matters. In addition, physics also lays the foundations for the new technological developments. A well-developed nation needs to have a solid foundation in physical sciences and technologies.<br>　　At the present, Taiwan is undergoing further transitions into a technology based society. We need to develop our basic physics research to enhance technological research and development. In particular, since nanotechnology is and will be a major part of scientific and technological developments internationally, a strong physics program in Taiwan is vital to our nanotechnological effort.<br>　　The NTU Physics Department is among the most well-established department in the country. We strive to help cultivate the national growth in the physical sciences and we hope that more young people will join us in this effort. The aim of the department is to gain a more thorough understanding of nature and find technological applications from such effort.</p>
