Faculty, Staff and Researchers<br>　　The Physics Department has a faculty quota of forty-eight. At the present, there are 51 professors, associate professors and instructors (36 full-time faculty members, 10 adjunct professor and 5 part-time faculty members). In addition, there are 5 full-time teaching assistants assigned to support the undergraduate program. This arrangement is unique among the local universities. In accord with the short and long term planning of the Department, and to maintain an active program, recruiting will continue in the next few years. The Department also has 10 staff members and technicians, which supports the teaching, research and administrative duties. The number of visiting professors and researchers vary on a yearly basis. In this academic year, the international academic exchange program brough in visiting professors, visiting research fellows, and postdoctoral fellows come from the United States, Ukraine, Czech Republic, South Korea, India and Mainland China. The influx of scholars from abroad promotes international collaboration among the visitors, students, and faculty members within the Department.<br>　　The Department of Physics is located in the same building as the National Taiwan University Center for Condensed Matter Sciences (personnel quota:30), Over twenty thousand square meters of space is accessible in the building. The close proximity between the two institutions promote mutual cooperation between the two academic units. Through joint and part-time appointment, the Department of Physics also has close contacts with various Institutes within the Academia Sinica including the Institute of Physics, the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (on campus), and the Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics. These collaborations enrich academic environment within the Department.<br><br>Main Fields of Research<br>　　Our research program seeks to find a balance between theory and experiment. The Departmental makes an effort to cover the main branches of modern physics. We are particularly keen on developing new research field. As a result, there are experienced faculty conducting research and advising students in the areas of:
